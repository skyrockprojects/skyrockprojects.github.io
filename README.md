## Welcome to Skyrock Projects Codehouse

Here's a sneak-peak at some of our projects:

### SKYROCK MINI
* **[Developing Apps with MIT AppInventor2](https://github.com/skyrockprojects/AppInventor2)**: In this project, students read data using Arduino + sensors, store it on cloud and then use APIs to fetch and display the data in an App made with MIT AppInventor2.

* **[Safely Please](https://github.com/skyrockprojects/safely-please)**: We build a car which can detect obstacles and find its way around them. Later on, we add more sensors to it to make it more and more _autonomous_.

* **[Otto-matic](https://github.com/skyrockprojects/otto-matic)**: We create Otto - a robot that can dance better than an average person. We learn how dance moves are encoded in lines of programming and how to assemble all the components together - Arduino, motors and software.
